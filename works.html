    <div class="info-panel active" id="metamorphosis">
      <h2>Metamorphosis</h2>
      <p>Metamorphosis is an immersive exhibition that highlights our skills in both sound design and 3D visual art through a collection of original audio-visual works. Presented in RMIT’s Blackbox, the space is reimagined with three large-scale projections that unfold dynamic 3D visuals in sync with layered, atmospheric soundscapes. A central element of the exhibition is a live performance, where real-time sound mixing drives audio-reactive 3D visuals across the walls, producing a constantly evolving environment. This interplay between sound and image offers a spontaneous and unpredictable experience. Exploring ideas of transformation and fluidity, Metamorphosis draws audiences into a multi-sensory journey where visuals, sound, and spatial design merge to create a truly transformative encounter.</p>

          <h3>Concept Development</h3>
          <p>This project provided valuable hands-on experience producing a public-facing audiovisual event focused on morphing water as the central theme. As the visual designer, I created immersive 3D environments and animations in Blender, carefully balancing creative ambition with technical constraints such as rendering limits on my low-GPU laptop. The lengthy soundtracks required generating a substantial volume of visual content, so I optimized scenes using Blender’s EEVEE engine, prioritizing visual impact over complexity to ensure feasible rendering times. Minor glitches in the video outputs were mitigated through close collaboration with the group and the VJ, whose live mixing helped cover technical imperfections.</p>
          <p>Working within a reliable and communicative team environment, I learned the importance of backup plans, productive dialogue, and collaborative problem-solving to overcome creative challenges. Test runs at the event venue revealed how visuals, DJ mixing, and ambient sound synergize to create an engaging and immersive audience experience. Overall, this first-time group project deepened my skills in technical execution, teamwork, and immersive spatial design. Navigating hardware limitations and live event dynamics strengthened my appreciation for flexible, adaptive workflows in audiovisual production.</p>

    <!-- DIGITAL IMPULSE -->
    <div class="info-panel" id="digitalimpulse">
      <h2>Digital Impulse</h2>
      <p>“Digital Impulse” is a looping projection installation that critically engages with the temporality and acceleration of human life brought about by digital culture. The installation seeks to interrogate the evanescent yet overwhelming visual and attentional stimulation characterised by an era of digital media consumption and information overload. </p>

          <h3>Concept Development</h3>
        <p>As a beginner in TouchDesigner, I engaged deeply with tutorials and experimented with Claude AI to refine my visual setups. I developed an audio-reactive circle and customized blob-tracking effects that integrate motion tracking and audio responsiveness. Through iterative experimentation and innovative problem-solving, I enhanced the project's interactive qualities, personalizing visual styles to align with the conceptual goals.</p>
        <p>In Blender, I explored generative and organic 3D animations as metaphors for the fragility of digital life. Using geometry nodes, I created abstract biomorphic forms and dynamic dot-and-line animations, continuously experimenting with displace modifiers and layered noise to achieve unique visual effects. This hands-on process emphasized feedback and iteration as critical creative tools.</p>
        <p>Collaboration played an essential role in this group project, strengthening my communication skills as a visual designer. Regular feedback sessions with tutors, peers, and family helped me refine composition, atmosphere, and animation coherence. Additionally, the technical challenges of in-person testing and projection mapping using Mad Mapper to project onto a mannequin developed my problem-solving skills and passion for immersive installation work.</p>
        <p>The project expanded both my technical expertise and creative approach, combining software proficiency with group collaboration and real-world installation experience. I particularly enjoyed tackling the technical complexities of projection mapping and creating an engaging spatial experience for audiences, highlighting my interest in the intersection of technology and immersive art.</p>

    <!-- DATA SHADOW -->
    <div class="info-panel" id="datashadow">
      <h2>Data Shadow</h2>
      <p>Our concept is called Data Shadow, which is an interactive exhibit designed to imply users’ digital footprints as growing shadows, indicating the persistent data prints left online. Interacting with the exhibition through the use of ACMI lens device, it explores the advancement of media, data shadow appeals users to question the suggestions of data-driven content, surveillance, and the blurred line between reality and hyperreality in the digital age.
Data Shadow is an interactive exhibit that reimagines the ACMI Constellation, designed to highlight the unseen presence of users’ digital footprints. The work visualizes these traces as expanding shadows, symbolizing the persistent data imprints left behind in online spaces.
By engaging with the installation through the ACMI Lens device, audiences experience the advancement of media and are invited to reflect on their own digital presence. Data Shadow raises critical questions around data-driven content, surveillance, and the blurred boundary between reality and hyperreality in today’s digital age.

        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>Data Shadow was a thought-provoking project that explored users’ digital footprints and the pervasive nature of data in contemporary life. Our interactive exhibit reimagined the ACMI Constellation, using expanding shadows as a metaphor for persistent online data traces. Through the ACMI Lens device, audiences were invited to critically reflect on surveillance, data-driven content, and the blurred lines between reality and hyperreality.

My primary contribution involved animating the infrastructure of ACMI’s Constellation using Blender, which formed the visual core of the exhibit’s video component. I then enhanced the video in After Effects, producing a polished informational piece that effectively communicated the project’s concept.

While the project presented some challenges in team dynamics, the overall experience was positive and educational. This work deepened my technical skills in 3D animation and post-production while encouraging me to engage with critical themes around data and digital presence.</p>

    <!-- BLOBTOPIA -->
    <div class="info-panel" id="blobtopia">
      <h2>Blobtopia</h2>
      <p>This project explored the theme of wellness and self-care through the design of an interactive app paired with an exhibition space. Our team developed an augmented reality (AR) self-care journey, supported by an immersive installation that enhanced the experience.
At the core of the app is a character called Blob, who guides users through various self-care activities. The choices made for Blob influence its emotional responses, allowing users to reflect on how different practices impact wellbeing.

        <p>My key contribution was modelling the 3D prototype of the character Blob in Blender. This prototype became the foundation for the AR component of the app, where users could view and interact with Blob in augmented reality.
