    <h2>Metamorphosis</h2>
    <p>Metamorphosis is an immersive exhibition that highlights our skills in both sound design and 3D visual art through a collection of original audio-visual works. Presented in RMIT’s Blackbox, the space is reimagined with three large-scale projections that unfold dynamic 3D visuals in sync with layered, atmospheric soundscapes. A central element of the exhibition is a live performance, where real-time sound mixing drives audio-reactive 3D visuals across the walls, producing a constantly evolving environment. This interplay between sound and image offers a spontaneous and unpredictable experience. Exploring ideas of transformation and fluidity, Metamorphosis draws audiences into a multi-sensory journey where visuals, sound, and spatial design merge to create a truly transformative encounter.

    <h3>Concept Development</h3>
    <p>
      This project provided valuable hands-on experience producing a public-facing audiovisual event focused on morphing water as the central theme. As the visual designer, I created immersive 3D environments and animations in Blender, carefully balancing creative ambition with technical constraints such as rendering limits on my low-GPU laptop.

The lengthy soundtracks required generating a substantial volume of visual content, so I optimized scenes using Blender’s EEVEE engine, prioritizing visual impact over complexity to ensure feasible rendering times. Minor glitches in the video outputs were mitigated through close collaboration with the group and the VJ, whose live mixing helped cover technical imperfections.
    </p>
    <p>
      Working within a reliable and communicative team environment, I learned the importance of backup plans, productive dialogue, and collaborative problem-solving to overcome creative challenges. Test runs at the event venue revealed how visuals, DJ mixing, and ambient sound synergize to create an engaging and immersive audience experience.

Overall, this first-time group project deepened my skills in technical execution, teamwork, and immersive spatial design. Navigating hardware limitations and live event dynamics strengthened my appreciation for flexible, adaptive workflows in audiovisual production.

    <h2>Digital Impulse</h2>
    <p>“Digital Impulse” is a looping projection installation that critically engages with the temporality and acceleration of human life brought about by digital culture. The installation seeks to interrogate the evanescent yet overwhelming visual and attentional stimulation characterised by an era of digital media consumption and information overload. 

Identified by theorists such as Byung-Chul Han (2022), Paul Virilio (2000) and Svetlana Boym (2001), the rapid adoption of digital technologies and its normalcy has contributed to the scattered attention-spans, accelerated perception and disembodiment of memory and introspection. How human-life is personally navigated, understood and memorised has been blurred by the constant competition of attention-economies. Digital Impulse employs the visual and auditory aesthetics of this digitally-induced overwhelm, and recontextualises them into an engaging video and lighting environment to call for contemplation.
The multisensory installation that integrates projection-mapping onto a central mannequin figure is contained by a three-channel surrounding environment. Both performing in tandem with abstracted visualisations, their choreographic assembly delivers an enlightening and confrontational experience and displays a cohesive environment. Filmed video, 3D visualisations made in Blender, visual effects stylised in Touch Designer and After Effects, video compositions edited in Premiere Pro, and the final output projected and mapped in MadMapper, construct the installation.

    <h3>Concept Development</h3>
    <p>
      Experimentation has been at the core of my creative process throughout this project. In Blender, I delved deeper into generative and organic 3D animation techniques, using geometry nodes and modifiers to create abstract biomorphic forms and dynamic visual movements. This hands-on exploration allowed me to understand the software’s potential as a medium for expressing complex, evolving digital environments.
    </p>
    <p>
     Simultaneously, as a beginner in TouchDesigner, I began experimenting with its node-based interface and interactive capabilities, using tutorials alongside Claude AI to accelerate my learning. Incorporating AI as a tool helped me personalize and refine audio-reactive visuals such as circle animations and blob-tracking effects, bridging technical challenges with creative innovation. This iterative approach, combining traditional software skills with emerging AI assistance, expanded both my technical proficiency and conceptual thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Collaboration played an essential role in this group project, strengthening my communication skills as a visual designer. Regular feedback sessions with tutors, peers, and family helped me refine composition, atmosphere, and animation coherence. Additionally, the technical challenges of in-person testing and projection mapping using Mad Mapper to project onto a mannequin developed my problem-solving skills and passion for immersive installation work.
    </p>
    <p>The project expanded both my technical expertise and creative approach, combining software proficiency with group collaboration and real-world installation experience. I particularly enjoyed tackling the technical complexities of projection mapping and creating an engaging spatial experience for audiences, highlighting my interest in the intersection of technology and immersive art.</p>

    <p>
    Data Shadow was a thought-provoking project that explored users’ digital footprints and the pervasive nature of data in contemporary life. Our interactive exhibit reimagined the ACMI Constellation, using expanding shadows as a metaphor for persistent online data traces. Through the ACMI Lens device, audiences were invited to critically reflect on surveillance, data-driven content, and the blurred lines between reality and hyperreality.

My primary contribution involved animating the infrastructure of ACMI’s Constellation using Blender, which formed the visual core of the exhibit’s video component. I then enhanced the video in After Effects, producing a polished informational piece that effectively communicated the project’s concept.

While the project presented some challenges in team dynamics, the overall experience was positive and educational. This work deepened my technical skills in 3D animation and post-production while encouraging me to engage with critical themes around data and digital presence.
